## LPOO_<6><6> - <Beast_1984>

Your goal in this game is to kill every Beast that appears in your way, in the shortest time possible. You're trapped in a maze of movable blocks, and the only way to survive is by smashing your enemies between them. This might seem like an easy task, but as eggs evolve to Beasts, and its number increases, you'll soon realise that the power-ups will come in handy.

There's the option to choose from three different levels of difficulty but, regardless of your choice, the map will always be randomised. Once you win (or lose) the game, you'll be presented a scoreboard so that you can keep track of your performance improvements.

This project is being Beastly developed by Athos Freitas (up202108792), Lu√≠s Du (up202105385) and Sofia Pinto (up202108682) for LP00 2022/2023.

### Implemented Features

For now, we have implemented most of the main features of our project, such as *moving blocks*, *killing Beasts*, and *catching power-ups*, by either the player or the Beasts.

Some other not so perceivable features include the *Beasts following the player* as it moves, and the *respawning* of the player, whenever it loses a life.
